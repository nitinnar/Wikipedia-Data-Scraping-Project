**Project Title:** **Web Scraping and Data Extraction from Wikipedia Tables Using Python**
**Project Description:**
The Wikipedia Table Scraping project demonstrates the power of web scraping techniques using Python to automate the extraction of structured data from web pages. Specifically, this project focuses on scraping tabular data from Wikipedia articles, transforming the raw HTML content into a clean, organized dataset using tools like BeautifulSoup and Pandas.

Many Wikipedia pages contain useful tabular information such as historical data, statistics, lists, and comparative analyses. Instead of manually copying these tables into spreadsheets, this project automates the process by scraping the data directly from the HTML source, cleaning it, and converting it into a usable format like a Pandas DataFrame. This DataFrame can then be used for further analysis, visualization, or storage in databases.

**Key Components:**
Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup:

Parse the HTML content of Wikipedia pages using BeautifulSoup, a powerful Python library that simplifies the extraction of data from HTML and XML files.
Identify and extract specific <table> elements from the page. These elements often contain structured data on Wikipedia.
Traverse the table rows (<tr>), header cells (<th>), and data cells (<td>) to extract and clean the text content.
Data Cleaning and Transformation:

Clean the raw data by handling missing values, merging multi-line data cells, and stripping unwanted characters like HTML tags, spaces, or special symbols.
Ensure the extracted data is structured into columns and rows that are consistent and meaningful.
Pandas DataFrame Creation:

Use Pandas to convert the cleaned data into a structured DataFrame, a tabular format similar to Excel or SQL tables.
Ensure the DataFrame is well-formatted with appropriate column headers, making the data ready for further analysis or visualization.
Storage and Export:

After extracting and cleaning the table, the data can be exported in multiple formats such as CSV, Excel, or stored in databases for future use.
The extracted data can also be used in other Python-based data analysis libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualizations, or used for statistical analysis and machine learning models.


**Tools and Libraries Used:**
BeautifulSoup: For parsing and navigating through the HTML structure to locate and extract data from the <table> elements.
Pandas: For creating a structured DataFrame to hold the scraped table data, and for easy data manipulation, cleaning, and export.
Requests: To send HTTP requests to the Wikipedia page and retrieve the HTML content.
Jupyter Notebook/IDE: For running and testing the Python code interactively.


**Applications and Benefits:**
Data Automation: This project automates the time-consuming process of manually copying and organizing data from web tables.
Data Integration: The extracted data can be integrated into larger datasets for business analysis, research, or machine learning models.
Reusability: The Python code is reusable and adaptable to other tables on different web pages, making it versatile for various scraping projects beyond Wikipedia.
Real-time Data: With dynamic scraping, users can extract up-to-date information from Wikipedia whenever needed.


**Challenges Solved:**
Navigating Complex HTML Structures: Handling irregular or nested table structures within Wikipedia articles.
Handling Missing or Inconsistent Data: Cleaning and normalizing the data to ensure consistency and completeness.
Dynamic HTML Content: Dealing with dynamically loaded content and extracting only the necessary data.
